									<h2>Who we are</h2>
									<p>We are a network of Cambridge PhD students, with backgrounds in History, Computer Science, Psychology, Education, Biology, English Literature, Digital Humanities, and Entrepreneurship – all at the forefront of the application of AI in our fields. As PhD students our knowledge stems from 'in the trenches' experience at the very edge of current practice in AI across industry and education.</p>

									<h2>Our Mission</h2>
									<p>AI is in the process of fundamentally reshaping education and the workplace. High-quality AI literacy education is a necessity to secure the future flourishing of humanity. AIME Education draws on the knowledge of a network of Cambridge PhD students working at the frontier of AI across a range of disciplines and translates this into high-quality online course content for 16-18-year-old school students. As well as training for school staff.</p>
									<p>Our first flagship course: <strong>Generative AI in Context</strong>, will cover all aspects of AI from the technology itself to its cultural, social, psychological, ethical, and economic implications, giving schools the resources to help their staff and students excel as humans in the age of AI.</p>
									<p>Our goal is to reduce the gap between the forefront of research and the classroom curriculum to weeks, not years. To do this we will use the vehicle of a continuously updated, high-quality online course that can be rolled out seamlessly to cohorts of school students, equipping them with the fundamental knowledge and tools to thrive in their next steps in life.</p>

							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>We are building three tiers of online AI literacy course for 16-18-year-olds, ranging from 10 to 30 hours of ready-to-go state-of-the-art content that teachers with any subject expertise can supervise in classrooms. We are currently looking for partner schools to run pilot-projects, gather data, and continually improve our course offerings.</p>
							<h2>What we mean by AI literacy</h2>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-history"></span>
									<h3>History of AI</h3>
									<p>Where did this technology come from, and how might its origins determine its current nature and future trajectory? How does AI compare to previous technological revolutions? What, if anything, can we learn from previous periods of rapid technological change?</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-brain"></span>
									<h3>AI Fundamentals</h3>
									<p>How do key machine learning, linguistics, and statistics concepts change our understanding of and ability to master AI? What key insights emerge from a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences of digital and biological neural networks? How does a deeper understanding of the technology empower us to see likely future directions in its development and position ourselves advantageously?</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-tools"></span>
									<h3>AI in Practice</h3>
									<p>What concrete tips, tools, and techniques can help us use AI more effectively to realise its benefits for study and work? Have we all become programmers now that the new programming language is human language, and what are the implications of this? How can we harness AI to build bespoke learning tools to supercharge our studies? How can we demonstrate our AI competency to future employers?</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-balance-scale"></span>
									<h3>AI Risks and Ethical Considerations</h3>
									<p>What are the true cognitive-health risks of AI usage and how can we manage these? What is social AI, how is it impacting society and is this the future we want? How is AI affecting culture, our relationship with art, authenticity, trust, and truth? What is the environmental and hidden-labour cost of AI? What are we to make of narratives about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Superintelligence?</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-briefcase"></span>
									<h3>AI and the Future of Work</h3>
									<p>What does it mean to have a non-human form of cognitive labour, and is there a longer history here? How is AI actually impacting the economy? How can we prepare ourselves for the future of the workplace? What competitive advantages do humans have and how can we emphasise and develop these? What narratives are in circulation around augmentation and replacement? How can we preserve the dignity and purpose of humanity in a rapidly automating world? What does it mean to be human now and in the future?</p>
